So I took it upon myself to collect it for my own use. I might as well share it.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset includes **48,673** results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2025. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. The matches are strictly men\u0027s full internationals and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation\u0027s B-team, U-23 or a league select team.\n\n\u0060results.csv\u0060 includes the following columns:\n\n-   \u0060date\u0060 - date of the match\n-   \u0060home_team\u0060 - the name of the home team\n-   \u0060away_team\u0060 - the name of the away team\n-   \u0060home_score\u0060 - full-time home team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts\n-   \u0060away_score\u0060 - full-time away team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts\n-   \u0060tournament\u0060 - the name of the tournament\n-   \u0060city\u0060 - the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played\n-   \u0060country\u0060 - the name of the country where the match was played\n-   \u0060neutral\u0060 - TRUE/FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue\n\n\u0060shootouts.csv\u0060 includes the following columns:\n\n-   \u0060date\u0060 - date of the match\n-   \u0060home_team\u0060 - the name of the home team\n-   \u0060away_team\u0060 - the name of the away team\n-   \u0060winner\u0060 - winner of the penalty-shootout\n-   \u0060first_shooter\u0060 - the team that went first in the shootout\n\n\u0060goalscorers.csv\u0060 includes the following columns:\n\n-   \u0060date\u0060 - date of the match\n-   \u0060home_team\u0060 - the name of the home team\n-   \u0060away_team\u0060 - the name of the away team\n-   \u0060team\u0060 - name of the team scoring the goal\n-   \u0060scorer\u0060 - name of the player scoring the goal\n-   \u0060own_goal\u0060 - whether the goal was an own-goal\n-   \u0060penalty\u0060 - whether the goal was a penalty\n\n\u0060former_names.csv\u0060 includes the following columns:\n-   \u0060current\u0060 - name of the team as is used currently (or the last name if the team does not exist anymore)\n-   \u0060former\u0060 - former name used by said team\n-   \u0060start_date\u0060 - start date of when former name was used\n-   \u0060end_date\u0060 - end date of when former name was used\n\n[This notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martj42/basic-use-of-former-names-csv) shows the basics of how to use *former_names.csv*\n\nNote on team and country names: For home and away teams the *current* name of the team has been used. For example, when in 1882 a team who called themselves Ireland played against England, in this dataset, it is called Northern Ireland because the current team of Northern Ireland is the successor of the 1882 Ireland team. This is done so it is easier to track the history and statistics of teams.\n\nFor country names, the name of the country *at the time of the match* is used. So when Ghana played in Accra, Gold Coast in the 1950s, even though the names of the home team and the country don\u0027t match, it was a home match for Ghana. This is indicated by the neutral column, which says FALSE for those matches, meaning it was **not** at a neutral venue.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data is gathered from several sources including but not limited to Wikipedia, rsssf.com, and individual football associations\u0027 websites.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSome directions to take when exploring the data:\n\n-   Who is the best team of all time\n-   Which teams dominated different eras of football\n-   What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams\u0027 strength etc\n-   Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other\n-   Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in\n-   How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country\u0027s chances in the tournament\n-   Which teams are the most active in playing friendlies and friendly tournaments - does it help or hurt them\n\nThe world\u0027s your oyster, my friend.\n\n### Contribute\n\nIf you notice a mistake or the results are not updated fast enough for your liking, you can fix that by submitting a pull request on Github: https://github.com/martj42/international_results\n"}
